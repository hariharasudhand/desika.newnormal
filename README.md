Desi [d̪eːsi] are the people, cultures, and products of the Indian subcontinent and their diaspora, 
derived from Ancient Sanskrit देश (deśá), meaning Land or Country.[1] As "desi" is a loose term, countries that are
considered "desi" are subjective; however, it is often accepted that India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are Desi countries. Our focus of this site is to brainstorm problems, issues that we foresee in the post COVID world, and to brainstorm solutions, solutions can involve IT or non IT, but what we need now is a platform for Indian origins to share thoughts and discuss solutions.

This forum has been initiated by "Weeroda Technologies Pvt Ltd", we would request other companies and businesses to participate and
 utilize from this.
